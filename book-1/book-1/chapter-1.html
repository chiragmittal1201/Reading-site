<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<p>
Rhea Kapoor spent her entire life proving people wrong.
Today was no different.
The office air carried the scent of polished wood,
expensive cologne, the hum of activity beyond her glass
walls, a constant reminder of Kapoor Fashion’s
relentless pace. Sunlight poured through the floor-toceiling windows, but it did nothing to warm the chill of
doubt creeping into her thoughts. The file on her desk
contained the latest campaign proposal—one that had to
succeed; Failure was not an option.
She exhaled, steeling herself. No distractions. No
mistakes. She had to be perfect.
A knock at the door pulled her back. Before she could
respond, the door swung open, and a tall man with
effortless confidence stepped inside.
Vivaan Mehra.
His reputation had preceded him—a former freelance
photographer now working with their PR team. His
work was brilliant, but he was known for being too
casual, too reckless. He was tall and athletic, with a
rugged charm that made him look like he belonged
more at a fashion shoot than in a corporate office. His
tousled black hair fell slightly over his forehead as if
he’d just run a hand through it, and the faint stubble
along his jawline only added to his effortless appeal. But
it was his eyes—hazel with a mischievous glint—that
hinted at trouble.
Rhea arched a brow, unimpressed by the easy grin on
his face. Great. Another overconfident artist.
Vivaan, on the other hand, was taking her in as well.
She was exactly as he had imagined—sharp features,
long, sleek black hair that framed her face with
elegance, and deep brown eyes that could cut through a
person’s soul. Dressed in a tailored navy-blue blazer
over a crisp white blouse, she looked every bit the
powerful CEO, the kind of woman who commanded
attention without asking for it. She carried herself with
an air of control, but he could tell there was more
beneath the surface.
The PR manager, standing beside him, cleared her
throat. “Vivaan, welcome to Kapoor Fashion. We’re
excited to have you on board.”
“Excited? That’s a first,” he quipped, adjusting his
camera. “Usually, people just want me to stay out of
trouble.”
The PR manager chuckled. “Well, try to stay out of
trouble with this one. You’ll be working closely with
Rhea Kapoor. She’s been the face of the company since
she was 14, and now she’s running the show.”
Vivaan raised an eyebrow. “CEO and the brand’s face?
That’s a lot for one person.”
“She was groomed for this,” the PR manager said
simply. “She knows the business inside out, but let’s just
say… she has a lot to prove.”
Vivaan leaned against the doorway, intrigued. “Sounds
like I’m in for an interesting job.”
Rhea finally spoke, her tone measured. “If you’re done
with the small talk, we have work to do.”
Vivaan grinned. “Sounds like a lot of pressure. I hope
she’s not too terrifying.”
Rhea’s eyes flickered with mild annoyance. “I’m right
here, you know.”
Vivaan smirked. “Good. Saves me the trouble of asking.”
She leaned back, studying him. “Let’s get one thing
straight—I don’t have time for nonsense. This campaign
has to be perfect. If you can’t deliver, tell me now.”
Vivaan tilted his head, pretending to consider.
“Perfection’s a bit overrated. But don’t worry, ma’am,
I’ll make sure your brand shines.”
Cocky. But let’s see if he can back it up.
Rhea didn’t reply immediately. Instead, she pushed a
file toward him. “Go through the brand guidelines, past
campaigns, and target demographics. I need fresh ideas,
not recycled trends.”
Vivaan picked up the file, flipping through the pages
with mild interest. “So, no pressure at all.”
“None,” Rhea said, voice clipped. “Your work will be
seen by millions. If you mess up, you’ll take the brand
down with you.”
Vivaan let out a low whistle. “Wow, you really know how
to welcome a guy.”
The PR manager cleared her throat. “Rhea has high
standards. I’m sure you’ll rise to the challenge.”
Vivaan shot Rhea a playful smirk. “Oh, I love a good
challenge.”
Rhea exhaled sharply, already feeling a headache
forming. This man was going to be insufferable.
Let’s see if he can match his arrogance with actual
talent.
