<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<p>Rhea Kapoor spent her entire life proving people wrong. Today was no different.</p>

<p>
The office air carried the scent of polished wood, expensive cologne, the hum of activity beyond her glass walls, a constant reminder of Kapoor Fashion’s relentless pace. Sunlight poured through the floor-to-ceiling windows, but it did nothing to warm the chill of doubt creeping into her thoughts. The file on her desk contained the latest campaign proposal—one that had to succeed; Failure was not an option.
</p>

<p>She exhaled, steeling herself. No distractions. No mistakes. She had to be perfect.</p>

<p>
A knock at the door pulled her back. Before she could respond, the door swung open, and a tall man with effortless confidence stepped inside.
</p>

<p><strong>Vivaan Mehra.</strong></p>
<p>
His reputation had preceded him—a former freelance photographer now working with their PR team. His work was brilliant, but he was known for being too casual, too reckless. He was tall and athletic, with a rugged charm that made him look like he belonged more at a fashion shoot than in a corporate office. His tousled black hair fell slightly over his forehead as if he’d just run a hand through it, and the faint stubble along his jawline only added to his effortless appeal. But it was his eyes—hazel with a mischievous glint—that hinted at trouble.
</p>

<p>Rhea arched a brow, unimpressed by the easy grin on his face. Great. Another overconfident artist.</p>

<p>
Vivaan, on the other hand, was taking her in as well. She was exactly as he had imagined—sharp features, long, sleek black hair that framed her face with elegance, and deep brown eyes that could cut through a person’s soul. Dressed in a tailored navy-blue blazer over a crisp white blouse, she looked every bit the powerful CEO, the kind of woman who commanded attention without asking for it. She carried herself with an air of control, but he could tell there was more beneath the surface.
</p>
<p>
The PR manager, standing beside him, cleared her throat. “Vivaan, welcome to Kapoor Fashion. We’re excited to have you on board.”
</p>

<p>
“Excited? That’s a first,” he quipped, adjusting his camera. “Usually, people just want me to stay out of trouble.”
</p>

<p>
The PR manager chuckled. “Well, try to stay out of trouble with this one. You’ll be working closely with Rhea Kapoor. She’s been the face of the company since she was 14, and now she’s running the show.”
</p>

<p>
Vivaan raised an eyebrow. “CEO and the brand’s face? That’s a lot for one person.”
</p>

<p>
“She was groomed for this,” the PR manager said simply. “She knows the business inside out, but let’s just say… she has a lot to prove.”
</p>

<p>
Vivaan leaned against the doorway, intrigued. “Sounds like I’m in for an interesting job.”
